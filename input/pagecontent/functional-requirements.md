Functional requirements describe the capabilities the system must have in order to meet the end-users’ needs and achieve tasks within the business process.

The functional requirements are listed in the high-level functional and non-functional requirements implementation tool, available [here](system-requirements.html).

Please note that these are not exhaustive lists and should be modified according to context and user persona needs.
