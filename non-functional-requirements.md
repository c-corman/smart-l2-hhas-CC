## Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements provide the general attributes and features of the digital system to ensure usability and overcome technical and physical constraints. Examples of non-functional requirements include providing password-protected access for authorized users, logging all data and system errors, and provide the ability to easily back up information.

Non-functional requirements are listed in the high-level functional and non-functional requirements implementation tool, available [here](system-requirements.md).
