The data dictionary outlines the minimum set of data corresponding to different points of the workflow within the identified business processes. The data set can be used on any software system and lists the data elements relevant for service delivery and executing decision-support logic, and for populating indicators and performance metrics.

One of the key principles used to guide the formulation of the core data set was:

* Open Standards: Aligned with the principle of open access to standards. Proprietary terminology code systems or proprietary standards cannot be recommended to Member States.
