## Concepts

Concepts relevant for a HHAS solution:

**CAP** - The CAP is a simple but general format for exchanging all-hazard emergency alerts and public warnings over all kinds of networks. CAP allows a consistent warning message to be disseminated simultaneously over many different warning systems, thus increasing warning effectiveness while simplifying the warning task.

**Healthcare facility** - Facilities are physical care delivery sites such as hospitals, clinics, health outposts, physician offices, labs, pharmacies, etc. A Facility has a unique identifier, geographic attributes (address, geocode), contact attributes, attributes regarding its hours of operation, etc.[1](#fn:1).

**Healthcare organization** - Organizations are "umbrella" entities; these may be considered the administrative bodies under whose auspices care services are provided such as Healthcare Information Exchanges (HIEs), Integrated Delivery Networks (IDNs), Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), Faith-Based Organizations (FBOs) or even a one-physician family practice. An organization has a unique identifier and may have additional administrative attributes such as contact person, mailing address, etc. Departments of an institution, or other administrative units, may be represented as child Organizations of a parent Organization[1](#fn:1).

**Health facility registries** - A central authority to uniquely identify all places where health services are administered within a country[2](#fn:2).

**Health worker registry** - Central authority for maintaining the unique identities of healthcare providers within a country[2](#fn:2).
